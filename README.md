## My process

### Built with

- Semantic React components
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I applied what I learned in React and CSS of the program, implementing them in an effective way and using flexbox for a more dynamic and personalized design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```React
<div className={classes.price}>
          <img
            className={classes.icon}
            src="images/icon-music.svg"
            alt="icon music"
          />
```
```css
.card {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 15px;
  max-width: 450px;
  width: 380px;
  margin: auto;
  text-align: center;
  align-items: center;
  box-shadow: 0px 30px 45px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  justify-items: flex-start;
  flex-direction: column;
  font-size: 16px;
  font: "Red Hat Display", sans-serif;
}

```


### Continued development

For future projects, I will focus on image optimization to ensure fast loading times. I'll also explore more about implementing CSS to improve the user experience.
